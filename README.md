# purly âœ‚

Scalable and distrubuted SaaS platform for managing your brand links. Under active development. Primary goal of this project is to create sample that **does more** than just simple CRUD.

> Frontend is still in very early stage of development. It lacks proper error handling and will receive major upgrade when core features will be done.

### Todo

- write e2e tests (currently partially written for user, workspace and auth modules)
- create CI pipeline

## Development

Project uses [Nx workspaces](https://nx.dev/) for building and handling monorepo structure.

### Run databases and services

```sh
cd docker
docker compose up
```

### Run setup scripts

```sh
# will install depedencies and create .env file
npm run setup
# run migrations (will run migrations against database defined in env.POSTGRES_URI)
npm run db:migrate
# run migrations for stats database (definied CLICKHOUSE_ env variables)
npm run stats:migrate
```

### Configure S3 with MiniO (optional)

Purly uses [MinIO](https://min.io/) to simulate AWS S3 for local development. We suggest to use AWS CLI for initial configuration.

Read about S3 local setup in `/tools/s3-local/README.md`

### Run applications (api, worker and frontend web app)

```sh
npm run serve
```

### Forward Stripe webhook locally

Purly uses `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_PATH` variable for webhook URL obfuscation. Don't forget to replace it in production with your own random value.

```sh
stripe login # only once - stripe will remember your session
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/stripe/webhook/e7a42abb5d31ec92bdfeec3cb0a4fa1b
```

> Stripe CLI will give you webhook signing secret like `whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. Save this value in .env as **STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET** and restart API. CLI gives you the same secret so no need to repeat this step every time you run listen command.

## Contributing

Currently project is in early stage of development and many things are changing so often. Keep it in mind if you want to contribute.

1. Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commits and PRs.
2. If you want to introduce bigger change I recommend to create issue first with feature request and get approval from mantainer :) Otherwise your pull request can be declined and you will waste your time.
3. After changes in table schemas, run `db:generate` script to generate migrations and run `db:migrate` to run migration.
